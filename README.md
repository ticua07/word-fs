![Main page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ticua07/word-fs/master/assets/main.png)

Save your files in a single DB, retrieve them anytime you want with a 3-word code

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/ - Svelte components here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/ - Layouts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/ - API, get/ and index pages here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/ - Utils, mostly word generating
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ db/ - DB's schema and singleton
```

This proyect uses svelte for more complicated tasks, like sending and retrieving files.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
